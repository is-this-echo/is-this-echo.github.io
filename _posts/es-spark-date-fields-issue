talk about the data type mismatch issue, due to elastic dynamic mapping, auto infer schema
how to fix-> explicit index mappings, provide commands or link to the other blog post
how to check in kibana, uncheck <hide empty fields>, date issue while loading data

date formats used -- variable millisecs, optional_date_time(with 'T' separator)

paste error code, less verbose
fix -- spark.read options : es.read.field.include -> non-conflicting field(s) - returns specific fields
(we want a field which is unique and based on which we count the dataframe records)
also specify query and match phrase
