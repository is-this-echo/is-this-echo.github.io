*Bonjour*,

I am Debjyoti Ghosh, final year student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur and this is my personal blog.
Here, I will be sharing my thoughts, experiences and learnings as I move forward in life.

</div>

I've always been fascinated by the wonders of technology and how it intertwines with our daily lives. Through this blog, I want to create a space where I can openly express my thoughts and discoveries in a relatable way. You can expect a mix of personal experiences, lessons learned, and maybe even a few funny anecdotes along the way.

I feel that writing blog on literally anything- projects, events, experiences can be rewarding as it helps to revision the entire thing, focus on nitty gritty stuff, simulate deep thinking and inculcate
a sense of introspection and self-reflection.

So, buckle up and join me on this journey as we dive into the fascinating world of technology, and explore how it shapes our lives, one post at a time!"
